# Who am I?
My name is Luka Ljubojević (21 M). I'm a full-time student at Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies - Rijeka, Croatia, third year of the undergraduate study.

I possess knowledge in Computer Networks, Computer Systems Architecture, Network Operating Systems, Operating Systems in general, Managing Computer Systems, IT Systems Security, relational databases (Oracle), and I understand the basics of programming (Python and C++).

I have basic experience, through classes or independent work, in: Docker Containers and creating them using Compose tool, Ansible, Scaleway cloud instances, QEMU, virt-manager, bash scripting, VMWare Player, Redis caching system, load balancer HAProxy. Apache – XAMPP, MariaDB (MySQL) and Oracle OraDB DBMS, GitHub – for student projects in various classes.

Also, non-related to this brach, I gained some knowledge in: Data and Database modeling (ER method), Creating HTML websites, Algorithms, Object-oriented programming, Web programming (frontend and backend) and IT project management.

My passion is installing, managing, configuring and maintaining computer systems. I dedicate myself to it in my free time.

I daily use ArchLinux. It's simply, in my opinion, the best.

# How it all started?
Since elementary school I have been researching computer hardware and operating systems. I first learned to assemble computers and then I discovered how to properly install an operating system. 
Later, I continuted playing with operating systems and found about virtual machines (VMWare, Oracle Virtualbox). I found that I like spending time playing with virtual machines so i tried installing and configuring various Linux distros, Windows Server editions, misc and retro operating systems like ReactOS, OS/2, DOS, etc. 

I decided to attend a technical high school - computer science courses. There I learned about IT, programming, Computer networks, hardware, etc. 
I continued my path into IT by enrolling in Informatics at the University of Rijeka - Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies. There I went deeper into Computer Networks, Security, Managing Linux Systems, Programming in C++, Web development, Project management, Multimedia, etc. I plan to continue my master study.

# What is my motivation and why does this repo exist?
In the second year of study I attended some System specific courses and discovered the job System Administrator and scope of his/her work. I found myself in that role so I started to learn what is needed to become one. 

This repo is a by-product of my specialization in the System Administration field, I shared it for other students, my colleagues, who would like to be System Administrators but don't know where to start.

This repo isn't perfect - since I'm still a student and I don't work as a SysAdmin, and it's goal isn't to prove anyone anything, it contains my personal notes while learning varous topics which I decided to share with the world.

If you are a SysAdmin, and would like to help me become one or you have some comments about my repo, contact me - I'm very keen to learn everything.

Special thanks to my professor [doc. dr. sc. Vedran Miletić](https://vedran.miletic.net/) who took the time to instruct me in what I should learn for the job.

# Notes about repo
* **Work in Progress!**
* Finish TODO in Systemd tutorial
* My next step is to write my undergraduate thesis and go through [cdrrazan's](https://github.com/cdrrazan/learn-system-admin-in-10-weeks) github repo: learn-system-admin-in-10-weeks and write markdown notes about my research.
