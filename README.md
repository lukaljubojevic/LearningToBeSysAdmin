# LearningToBeSysAdmin
My notes while learning to become a SysAdmin

# Who am I?
My name is Luka Ljubojević. Im am a full-time student at Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies - Rijeka, third year of the undergraduate study.

I possess informative knowledge on Computer Networks, Network Operating Systems, Operating Systems in general, Managing Computer Systems, IT Systems Security, relational databases (Oracle), and I understand the basics of programming (Python and C++).

I have basic experience, through classes or independent work, in: Docker Containers and creating them using Compose tool, Ansible, Scaleway cloud instances, QEMU, virt-manager, bash scripting, VMWare Player, Redis caching system, load balancer HAProxy. Apache – XAMPP, MariaDB (MySQL) and Oracle OraDB DBMS, GitHub – for student projects in various classes.

My passion is installing, managing, configuring and maintaining computer systems. When I have time, I dedicate myself to my hobby – operating systems and hardware.

I daily use ArchLinux. It's simply, in my opinion, the best.

# How it all started?
I've spent a lot of hours using VMWare Player software and installing different systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS – old and new editions), and, sometimes, I would install them on physical hardware.
